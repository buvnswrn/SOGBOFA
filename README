OVERVIEW

SOGBOFA is a state-fo-the-art stochastic online planning algorithm that specializes on MDPs that have large state and action spaces. It uses the idea of "Aggregate Simulation" to build a computation graph which symbolically approximates the Q value of actions given the current state, and searches the action space very efficiently using gradient updates. It supports various action constraints defined in first-order predicates. It directly works with MDP domains defined in RDDL, and is implemented based on the original code of the RDDL simulator

   Please cite our paper if you are using the planner as a baseline, and/or star the project if you like it ^_^

NEWS

* We fix the bugs and add supports to more action constraints. For more details, see our most recent ICAPS 2019 paper
   http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/rkhardon/PUB/icaps2019-LCsogbofa.pdf
  We are able to outperform the winner of IPC2018/2014/2011 with a large margin

* The latest version of SOGBOFA with the new extention of "lifting" and "conformant" is the runner-up of the most recent IPC2018 competition. For more information, see the competition web page 
   https://ipc2018-probabilistic.bitbucket.io/ 
  Note that since SOGBOFA did not fully support all the competition constraints by then, it crashed on quite some problems.

HOW TO USE

* Prerequisites: Java SE 1.8 or higher
* Run the server
  One can either run the server from RDDLSim Project, or compile and run the Server.java included in our source code with the following arguments
  rddlfilename-or-dir portnumber num-rounds random-seed timeout 
  example:
  /instances 2323 100 1 10000
* Run SOGBOFA
  compile and run the SOGBOFA.java included in our source code with the following arguments
  instance-name portnumber
  example:
  traffic_inst_mdp__10 2323
* Results
  After finishing the requested number of runs, the server will record 6 files, with the following names
  L_C_SOGBOFA_timeout_isntance-name_Score
  L_C_SOGBOFA_timeout_isntance-name_depthCounter
  L_C_SOGBOFA_timeout_isntance-name_sizeCounter
  L_C_SOGBOFA_timeout_isntance-name_rrCounter
  L_C_SOGBOFA_timeout_isntance-name_seenCounter
  L_C_SOGBOFA_timeout_isntance-name_updatesCounter
  which record respectively the average score of the runs, the average depth of the search, the average size of the computation graph, the average number of radnom restarts, the average number of action evaluated, the average number of gradient updates.
  The Score file has three numbers, respectively the instance index, the average cumulative reward, and the standard deviation. The other files only has one number inside.
