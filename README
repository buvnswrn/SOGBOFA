OVERVIEW

SOGBOFA is a state-fo-the-art stochastic online planning algorithm that specializes on MDPs that have large state and action spaces. It uses the idea of "Aggregate Simulation" to build a computation graph which symbolically approximates the Q value of actions given the current state, and searches the action space very efficiently using gradient updates. It supports various action constraints defined in first-order predicates. It directly works with MDP domains defined in RDDL, and is implemented based on the original code of the RDDL simulator

   Please cite our paper if you are using the planner as a baseline, and/or star the project if you like it ^_^

NEWS

* We fix the bugs and add supports to more action constraints. For more details, see our most recent ICAPS 2019 paper
   http://homes.sice.indiana.edu/rkhardon/PUB/icaps2019-LCsogbofa.pdf
  We are able to outperform the winner of IPC2018/2014/2011 with a large margin.

* The latest version of SOGBOFA with the new extention of "lifting" and "conformant" is the runner-up of the most recent IPC2018 competition. For more information, see the competition web page 
   https://ipc2018-probabilistic.bitbucket.io/ 
  Note that since SOGBOFA did not fully support all the competition constraints by then, it crashed on quite some problems.

HOW TO USE

* Prerequisites: Java SE 1.8 or higher
* Compile
  In the SOGBOFA/ directory, type command ./compile
* Run the server
  One can either run a server from the RDDLSim Project, or run the Server class compiled from our source code with the following command
  ./run_server rddlfilename-or-dir portnumber num-rounds random-seed timeout 
  For example:
  ./run_server Domains 2323 100 1 10000
  Note that the time out is the total time (in seconds) allowed to any client connects to it.
* Run SOGBOFA
  Type the following command
  ./run_sogbofa instance-name portnumber
  example:
  ./run_sogbofa traffic_inst_mdp__10 2323
* Results
  After finishing the requested number of runs, 6 files will be recorded in the bin/ folder, with the following names
  L_C_SOGBOFA_timeout_instance-name_Score
  L_C_SOGBOFA_timeout_instance-name_depthCounter
  L_C_SOGBOFA_timeout_instance-name_sizeCounter
  L_C_SOGBOFA_timeout_instance-name_rrCounter
  L_C_SOGBOFA_timeout_instance-name_seenCounter
  L_C_SOGBOFA_timeout_instance-name_updatesCounter
  which record respectively the average score of the runs, the average depth of the search, the average size of the computation graph, the average number of radnom restarts, the average number of action evaluated, the average number of gradient updates.
  The Score file has three numbers, respectively the instance index, the average cumulative reward, and the standard deviation. The other files only has one number inside.

RDDL FILES FOR ICAPS2019 PAPER

Please find all domain and instance files that we used in the ICAPS 2019 paper in the Domains/ folder. It includes all IPC2018 competition problems and the elevators domain from IPC2014.

IJCAI2016 VERSION

We have a copy of the source code used in the experiments of our IJCAI2016 paper (the very first SOGBOFA paper), but for consistency we no longer maintain github page for that version. If you are interested, please contact bitcuihao@gmail.com and we'll directly send you the code and instructions.
